## Java programming course projects:

These are 2 projects that I have developed when I made a Java course ministered by Leonardo Leit√£o from Cod3r. 
It dives into Java as main programming language and have window-based applications using Swing and AWT to provide GUI. 

### The projects are:

- Project 1: <a href="https://github.com/augustoafleal/java-projects/tree/master/calculadora">Calculator</a> - Application using AWT

- Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/augustoafleal/java-projects/tree/master/campo-minado-swing">Minesweeper</a> - Application using Swing
