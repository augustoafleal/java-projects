# Java Programming Course Projects

These are two projects that I developed while taking a Java programming course taught by Leonardo Leit√£o from Cod3r. The course covered Java as the main programming language and included creating window-based applications using Swing and AWT to provide GUI.

## Projects

The two projects I completed during the course are:

### Project 1:  <a href="https://github.com/augustoafleal/java-projects/tree/master/calculadora">Calculator</a> - Application using AWT

This project is a simple calculator application created using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). It provides basic arithmetic operations and a user-friendly interface.

### Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/augustoafleal/java-projects/tree/master/campo-minado-swing">Minesweeper</a> - Application using Swing

This project is a recreation of the classic Minesweeper game, created using Swing. It features a grid-based game board with randomly placed mines, and allows the player to mark cells as potentially containing mines, as well as uncover cells to reveal their contents.

## Technologies Used

The projects were developed using the following technologies:

- Java programming language
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
- Swing
